# Smorphi-Smart-Maze-Follower
This project integrates QR code recognition using HuskyLens AI Camera and autonomous maze solving using bottom-facing IR sensors on the Smorphi modular robot. Designed for robotics competitions and smart navigation challenges, the system combines basic AI vision with logic-based decision-making to explore, follow, and exit line-based mazes.
